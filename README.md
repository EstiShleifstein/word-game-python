# Word Game in Python 
Welcome to "Grow", a word game inspired by a popular brain-training game from the app Peak. This engaging word challenge tests your vocabulary and quick-thinking skills. The objective is simple: generate as many correct words as possible using a random selection of the first two letters provided.
## Game Overview 
The game utilizes a comprehensive word list sourced from [this](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt) GitHub repository. To ensure a fair and challenging experience, only letter combinations with a substantial number of valid words are included, while others are excluded from gameplay.
